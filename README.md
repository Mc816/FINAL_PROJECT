# Introduction:

This is a web application that features a user and Disney character model. The application includes user sign-up, sign-in, and log-out features. Once signed in, users can create their own Disney character and search for characters using a third-party API.

The inspiration for this application came from my love for Disney and the desire to showcase it to the world.

## Technologies Used:

To create this full MERN stack application, I utilized several technologies, including:

Node.js
React
Express
MongoDB/Mongoose
React-Router-Dom
Dotenv
Axios

I also utilized a third-party API, specifically https://api.disneyapi.dev/character, to fetch data for the search results.

### Getting Started:

To understand how I planned the project, you can view the project outline on the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/J4X4j75a/finalproject).

To experience the live site and enjoy the web application, you can visit the [Disney Character Web Application](https://final-project-kt0s.onrender.com) to view it in your browser.

### Unsolved Problems:

One unresolved problem is that when the application refreshes, the information from MongoDB (which is still stored in the database) no longer renders properly. The same issue occurs with the third-party API data. However, users can create new characters despite this problem.

### Future Enhancements:

In the future, I plan to add more functionality to the application. Specifically, I would like to incorporate a favorites feature using CRUD operations, allowing users to save their favorite created characters or searched items.
